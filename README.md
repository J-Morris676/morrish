## Morrish
Commands that makes things easier for me, mostly wrappers around long tedious commands

## Usage
1. Clone it
2. Source it using your favourite profile:
    - `echo -e "\nsource ~/dev/morrish/index.sh" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile`

Updating it only requires a Git pull the project
